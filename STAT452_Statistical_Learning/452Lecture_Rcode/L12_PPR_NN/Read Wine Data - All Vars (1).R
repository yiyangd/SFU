### Activate the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

### Read-in dataset
data.in = read.csv("Datasets/Wine Quality.csv")


### Use transmute to rename variables, recode quality, and remove
### variables we aren't interested in. The case_when() function lets
### us divide a variable into groups and have different outputs
### across groups. You don't need to know the details.
